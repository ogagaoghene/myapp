                    We are running out of time. We have polluted our people in this planet to the brink of extinction.
                    We need therefore a pollution revolution. But, it is not going to be easy because the world is 
                    addicted to fossil fuels. By fossil fuels, I mean coal natural gas and black gold popularly
                    known as petroleum.

                    If we are to survive our environmental crisis and maintain the Earth as a place fit for the human 
                    life. We must sharply reduce the massive pollution of the Biosphere. To do this we must recognize
                    that pollution and other environmental crisis and not incidental by-products of technology. 
                    Technology then is the source of our present precarious relation to the ecosystem that 
                    supports us.

                    When man can go months without food and water. Man can only remain alive for a minute or two without
                    oxygen.

                    The greatest want of the world is the want of men. Men who will not be bought or sold. Men who in their 
                    inmost souls are true and honest. Men whose conscience is as true to duty as the needle is to the pole.
                    Men who will stand for the right though the heavens fall.
